# Simple Workday Scheduler

![Splash](README-assets/Splash.png)

# Description

A project for my bootcamp to create a simple workday scheduler. This has a small section for every hour (from 9am to 5pm), that the user can type in or change their plans. They can then save these changes with the button on the side, and this will keep that plans saved in local storage.

The page also tracks what day it is, and what the current hour is. Any blocks before the current hour is colored grey, the current hour is colored red, and future hours are colored green.
